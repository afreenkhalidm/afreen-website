As part of the DFG funded project "Populist Challenge in Parliaments" we scrape, download, OCR and parse more than 300,000 parliamentary questions in 15 German federal states and link them to a relational database. We create a relational database of state legislators after the role model of Simon Munzert's and Sascha GÃ¶bel's legislatoR. Like legislatoR, it is based on wikipedia. Image source: www.wikipedia.de
